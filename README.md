#Welcome!

 I am an MA student studying English literature with a specialization in Digital Humanities at Carleton University.I plan to start my PhD in English in the fall of 2016.

The goal of this project is to introduce English students and academics to the ways in which DH can benefit your research and pedagogy. As a growing interdisciplinary field with vast amounts of talented scholars building exciting new things, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and to not know where to find one’s niche. My hope is that this project will offer some interesting and user-friendly methods to get involved in DH and that it will encourage users to continue experimenting. 

The tutorials and studies here are by no means all-encompassing, but is designed for beginners and those with no programming experience.  

This is intended to be an inclusive space. The DH world can be exclusive, while the Internet in general is sometimes a threatening place for those who diverge from the white-male “norm” (or even for those white males as well!). I am committed to making spaces for everyone and to publish with awareness of these issues.

*My research interests:* Nineteenth century literature and culture, popular culture, gender, queer theory, the gothic, sympathy and sentimentality, literary theory, archive theory, social media and identity construction, wikipedia, digital humanities, text analysis, accessibility 

#Writing in Public 

As this is managed through Github, it is open access. I appreciate all contributions and feedback as I continue to grow this project and make it more expansive and useful for interested colleagues. Though this was started as a class project, I hope to continue adding tool tutorials and useful articles and reviews over the summer months.   

#What is a Tool Tutorial 

A tool tutorial is pretty much what it sounds like - an exploration and how-to guide of the basics of using a particular tool. My current tool tutorials are:

* Data Visualization
* Text Analysis
* Digital Mapping
* Digital Narrative

#Thank you

Thank you to Dr. Shawn Graham for his invaluable expertise and dedication to the DIGH5000 class. Thank you also to my brilliant colleagues - links to their projects are coming soon.
