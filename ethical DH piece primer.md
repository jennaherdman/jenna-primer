#Spotlight: Ethical, Inclusive, Accessible DH 

The Internet can be a dark and scary place. All too often, we see the same systemic biases which are all too prevalent in traditional academia being repeated online. Though there is a power in the anonymity of the Internet, it also threatens to detach the user from reality, causing them to behave in ways they might not in face-to-face interactions. 

This page is dedicated to putting a spotlight on some of the DH-ers who have written on issues. I think these are extremely important to read mindfully and critically. What do we risk by putting ourselves online? What do we sacrifice if we do not?

#Questions for Future Discussion 

* How do you define your online identities? How do you present yourself depending on the digital space? 
* What do you make of the stories we tell ourselves about internet communities? 
* What does it mean to be a person who is not a straight white male using the internet? Why is this so important to be aware of?
